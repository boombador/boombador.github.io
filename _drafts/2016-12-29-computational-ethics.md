title: Computational Ethics
---

Had some thoughts, wanted to write them down before I started researching

ethics is not static, must rely on current understanding of ethical responsibilities
borrows from stoic ideal of sage (need citation)
want to comport oneself in a perfectly ethical manner, impossible but better thought of as guiding principle

aim of ethics is to raise integral of ethical actions
but difficult in many instances to raise the manifold uniformly, usually rise in one side draws from dip elsewhere
does this preclude measures for long-term improvement that greviously injure few or even many in dire situations?

assign vector valued functions for space of ethical weights
decisions affect primary issues and less directly other issues, what is metric of distance?

what if reasoning could be modelled so precisely that it could be reliably represented and transformed, such as for anonymous cryptographic verification

modelling work seems to be making progress, a lot of what I was thinking about has been addressed somewhat here:
